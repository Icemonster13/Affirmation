# AFFIRMATION

Affirmation is a word game where the player tries to spell as many words as possible using the given phrase or affirmation.

## About Me

I am a self-taught amatuer programmer that likes to learn new things. This is my first attempt at programming using SWIFTUI.

Please take a look and provide whatever constructive criticism you may have to help me learn.

I hope you enjoy the game!


## Additional Information

Affirmation is inspired by my beautiful wife, Diana. She loves to just make lists of words as a way to calm her mind.

THANK YOU Diana for being my everything and believing in me!
